# React Hooks Exercises

This repository contains a series of exercises I completed to practice and test various React hooks, including useEffect, useState, useRef, useLayoutEffect, useCallback, and useMemo.

The exercises included here are simple counters and forms, designed to demonstrate the usage and functionality of different hooks. Each exercise is contained in its own file, and an index file (`main.jsx`) is provided to select and display the desired application.

## Content

- **`/src`**: This directory contains all the source files for the hook exercises.
- **`main.jsx`**: Index file that allows you to select and display the desired application.

## Acknowledgments

These exercises were created for learning and practice purposes, inspired by the official React documentation and other online resources. I appreciate the developer community for sharing their knowledge and experiences.

Feel free to explore the exercises, make modifications, and experiment with the hooks to gain a better understanding of their functionality.

Enjoy learning about React hooks!
